Login Screen Project by Kezia Mari Cabalonga, Louie Steven Cadaguman, Jezreel Zaldarriaga

Welcome to our login screen!

These are the variants of animations and images that we used for our application development.
1.) Rive Animation
2.) GIF
3.) JPG
4.) PNG
5.) Flutter Animation
#Note: The corresponding files were stored on the the assets folder and most importantly added on the dependecies and assets on pubspec.yml for the app to recognize the files used.

We also designed 3 screens under the folder 'screens':
1.) Splash Screen (SplashScreen.dart)
2.) Login Screen (login.dart)
3.) Home (home.dart)

we separated the main method (main.dart) and another class file (FadeAnimation.dart) away from the screens folder so we would be able to easily determine future errors.

IDE we used is the VisualStudioCode.

APPLICATION MANUAL/ INSTRUCTIONS:

#Note: Opening or Running the app would first redirect you to the SplashScreen with a welcome message, developer's names, and a button.
   1.)To start, 'PRESS' the button to proceed to the login screen. . 
   2.)In the login Screen, provide the username and password then press login.
      Enter the following credentials:
      Username: cictapps@wvsu.edu.ph

#Note:  The login screen will now redirect you to the home screen.
        Our Home screen is less functional except for the Log-out button.
